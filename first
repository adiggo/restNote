HTTP : client sends something which formated into envolope, then pass to server. Document-based protocol.
HTTP has strict standard for what the envolope should look like.

GET
Host:
User-Agent
Accept
Accept-Language
Accept-Encoding
Accept-Charset
Keep-Alive
Connection

All the above are most reqeust headers (metadata)
for get method, entity-body is empty. All information in the path and headers.

Server response:

HTTP: code
Server:Apache
Last-modifiedL 
Etag
Accept-Range
Content-length
Content-type
X-Cache
Keep-Alive
Connection

So response contains: Response code, response header, entity-body
FIVE common HTTP methods: GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, POST

How and which range
the range is decided in the uri. 
Another alternative is putting it into entity body (SOAP)

Technology on web:
HTTP---> all webserive use HTTP, but in different way. request in restful web service puts the method
infomation in the HTTP method and the scoping info in the URI.
RPC-style tends to ignore HTTP method, looking for method and scoping info in the URI HTTP headers.

URI --> service endpoint

XML-RPC -->
